/*
In this practice assignment, we will create a simple calculator that will take two numbers
from a user and multiply them. It will store it in a variable and print out the result at the end.

These are the guided instructions for it:

1. Begin by adding some new lines to the run method.
2. Print a welcome message to the user.
3. Ask the user to enter the first number.
4. Utilize the getInteger() method to get the number and store it in a variable, you can name it anything.
5. Ask the user to enter the second number.
6. Utilize the getInteger() method to get the number and store it in a variable, you can name it anything.
7. Multiply these two integers together and store the result in a new variable called result.
8. Print out the result to the user using the print() method.

**The solution to this assignment can be found in the solution folder.**
